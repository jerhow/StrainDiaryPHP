# Strain Diary (PHP)
Lightweight tool for tracking, reviewing and organizing one's experiences with various strains of plant matter.
<br/><br/>
I originally [prototyped](https://github.com/jerhow/straindiary) this a few years ago as a REST API written in Go, with MySQL behind it and a monstrous, decoupled Vanilla JS front end on top. I got it about 90% complete before I put it aside.
<br/><br/>
I'm redoing now it with PHP 7 and MariaDB 10, for some reason. No frameworks, just trying to keep it lightweight and fun.<br/><br/>
